# Politico News Clone

Site: https://politico-clone.netlify.app/


The website mimics the Politico news site, and aggregates news articles about current topics.

## Features implemented:
**React Router** to render the landing page for the different top-nav categories, this was chosen as an efficient way to tie in the available categories to then render the landing page component.

**Bootstrap 4** is used as the CSS framework to minimize time spent on styling, and for its ease-of-use in setup.

**react-promise-tracker** package was used to track the promise while fetching the API via Axios. This is used to display to the user that the page is loading.
